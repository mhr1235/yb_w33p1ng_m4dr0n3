# yb_w33p1ng_m4dr0n3
w33p1ng m4dr0n3 is a virtual memorial to those who have died of Covid-19 in California.  A virtual 3D model of a native madrone tree is linked in real-time to publicly available health data published by the Covid Tracking Project at the Atlantic (https://covidtracking.com).  The tree sheds one blossom for each new daily Covid-19 death reported.  As the dataset is updated daily, the rate the blossoms fall changes to visualize the currently daily reported Covid-19 death rate among California residents.  w33p1ng m4dr0n3 is an homage both to those lost and those left behind to mourn and heal.  * this particular iteration of this project has been greatly reduced in graphics and functionality to better work with the bandwidth limitations of this specific exhibition.
